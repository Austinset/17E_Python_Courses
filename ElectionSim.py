#Current objectives for the Sim are:

#PvE or Solo Story mode
'''
Setting: Post-Election, the country is exploding at the seams. A diverse cabinet has been selected to address the issues plagueing the country. Due to the seriousness of the situation, each cabinet member 
has been granted emergency powers to deal with their respective crises. The president is, in all aspects, a bumbling idiot who makes everything worse for everyone. He will be the driver for player cooperation.
He is also leagues better than the objectively evil Vice President he has. The Vice President is an antagonist, but powerless unless something were to happen to the Prez. He loves to harass the players verbally.

Areas of the nation will be divided into "Regions", assignable tags/classes with a variety of adjustable parameters. 

DETHCON: A measure of how bad the situation is getting, unlocks player's abilities and powers. Measures 1-10, going up an amount(player selected, usually 1) every x(player selected, usually 2) turns

Each player will be a unique "cabinet member", assignable at the start of the game via random lottery or player selection.

Roles: 
    Chief of Staff
    Economy Minister
    Generalissimo
    Interior Minister
    Public Relations

At the start of the turn, there will be "Events" taking place on behalf of the prez. They will modify aspects of the nation and generally make life worse for the player.

The game will end by 
A. Losing control of the country and being overthrown outright.
B. Leading a military coup and forming either your own government or a junta if a leader can't be selected. The ending to pursue when the players can't fix the damage.
C. Actually helping the president win the next election, the "best" ending.
D. Country is stabilized, but the president loses, another "Good Ending".

Region parameters:
    Economy:
    Strength/Military:
    Stability:
    Approval:
    Chaos: 


Turn Phases:
Events: Acts of God (or the Prez) mess with the players 
Decisions: Players vote on a course of action. Sometimes its good to lose (if a policy goes bad, a player can gain approval)
Action!: Players go around and spend their energy to change things for the better (or worse)

#PvP mode / Traitor Mode
'''
Setting: Similar to the setting above, but now a player is the "President" with investigative powers and there is a "Traitor" amongst the players. The president can be assassinated or deposed
after several failed investigation checks.

Phases:
Same as above, with an additional
Sneak!: Traitor will go around and destroy/subvert things for everyone.
